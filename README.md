# CSE-News
A script that collects news from cs.uoi.gr and writes it to a database

# Usage

```sh
    $ python parser.py
    $ #The script will automatically download and install any required package. Therefore, there is no need to manually install any package. However, python pip is required for the automatic install to work.
    $ #XML file announcements.xml should have been created
```

# Todo
If you are interested this tasks are open at the moment
- Update the script so that it reads only *new* announcements (ignores announcements that are already in database/xml file)
